# Tower-Defense

A tower defense game written in python with PYQT6

## Description

This tower defense game was created because of a project at the university. Besides me, two others worked on it.
Our task was to program a (working, lol) tower defense game in Python using pyqt. Currently you can only play 3 rounds, the balancing is terrible (terribly easy).
The biggest problem was our task. Even our supervisor thought the approach to the program was poor. That's why the implementation of time is now the way it is.
